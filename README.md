# PatchKGH (pKGH)
:recycle:*Garbage in, garbage out* - classic saying for data curation in Computer Vision  
The KinGston General (KGH) dataset for colorectal polyps classification consists of **1037 Whole Slide Images** (WSIs) encompassing both healthy colon tissue and colon polyps. The pathological WSIs have been annotated at the region of interest (ROI) level by Dr. Sonal Varma using a software developed by Huron Digital Pathology. In order to train deep learning models for colorectal polyp classification applied to this dataset, we need to extrat patches from the WSIs. To achieve a good representation of this dataset, we need to perform strong data curation and extract patches, or tiles, which are cleaned and do not present with any artefacts.
